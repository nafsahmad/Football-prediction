# Football-prediction


Data science has come to play an important role in the football industry today. Clubs look to gain a competitive edge on and off the pitch, and big data is allowing them to extract insights to improve player performance, prevent injuries and increase their commercial efficiency.
The use of data science in sport has been boosted by technology systems which make it quicker and easier to capture a player's performance metrics and better interpret and share results.


## Aims and Objectives

The aim of this project is to use expected parameters to predict the winner of each football game.

The dataset for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slehkyi/extended-football-stats-for-european-leagues-xg).

## Model
The Catboost algorithm was adopted for this task. The resulting model has an f1-score of 0.74.
